# Advanced Folder Organizer 🗂️

This Python script helps you automatically organize files based on their type (like images, videos, documents, etc.).  
✅ Now supports sorting from **multiple folders**, and lets you choose:
- Organize files **together in one folder**
- Or **keep files organized separately per source folder**

---

## 📂 Features
- Sorts files by extension (e.g., `.jpg`, `.pdf`, `.mp4`, etc.)
- Handles **multiple source folders**
- Can save output in:
  - One merged folder (`Single`)
  - Or separate folders for each input (`Separate`)
- Automatically creates target folders if they don’t exist

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Run the script
2. Enter the number of folders you want to organize
3. Choose `Single` or `Separate` folder organization
4. All sorted files will appear in their respective folders!
